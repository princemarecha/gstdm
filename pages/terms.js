            <br/>
            The products of GSTDM, referred to collectively as “Tourist Services” and which are sold via the Website, consist of accommodation, transfers, excursions, tickets, vehicle hire and other receptive tourism services (the “Travel Services”). <br/>

            <br/> <b>3.- Website modifications and updates</b> <br/>
            <br/>
            GSTDM, the legal owner of the website, reserves the right to modify unilaterally, at any time and without prior notice, the information contained in this document, as well as the general terms and conditions published on the www.GSTDM.com website.

            GSTDM does not guarantee that the contents of its website will be fully up to date, accurate and/or available at all times, although every effort will be made for this to be so. Despite the fact that GSTDM wishes to provide the CLIENT with a continuous service through the website, this service may be interrupted for various reasons. In such cases and whenever possible, GSTDM will attempt to inform users sufficiently in advance, but accepts no responsibility whatsoever for any damages that users may incur as a result of interruptions to the service allowing access to the website.<br/>
            <br/>
            <b>4.- Website access</b><br/>
            <br/>
            Access to this website will be provided exclusively by GSTDM.<br/>
    
            Access to certain services is conditional to the user registering on the GSTDM database. In these cases the CLIENT agrees to duly safeguard the access codes (user name and password) as they are for sole use by their holder and the safeguarding and correct use of them is entirely the user’s responsibility. The CLIENT, which freely and voluntarily registers as a user or informs GSTDM of any personal data through the procedures established on this website, expressly authorises GSTDM to use said data to send the user commercial information about its products or services, until the user ceases to be a client of GSTDM. In any event, said data will be treated in accordance with the description provided in the “privacy policy” published on this website, and always respecting the legislation in force at all times in matters pertaining to personal data and services relating to the information society. All information provided for GSTDM by the CLIENT must be accurate. To this effect, the CLIENT guarantees the authenticity of any data it may provide as a consequence of completing the forms needed to register as a client or user. Similarly, the user will be responsible for ensuring that all information provided to GSTDM is kept permanently up to date, so that it corresponds at all times to the user’s real situation. In any event, the CLIENT shall be held solely responsible for any false or inexact information provided and for any damages that this may cause to GSTDM or any third parties due to the information provided.<br/>
    
            <br/><b>5.- Unauthorised use</b><br/>
            <br/>
            The CLIENT or the users in general who use this website agree not to make any use of this site for any purposes or activities that are illegal or illicit, or that contravene the norms of good conduct, and have no right to modify any of the materials included on our website, nor to copy, distribute, broadcast, present, produce or in general reproduce in any way, publish, authorise or create any work based on the information or the content included on this website.<br/>
    
            <br/><b>6.- Process for contracting services</b><br/>
            <br/>
            6.1 Age and responsibility<br/>
    
            <br/>The CLIENT guarantees i) that it makes legitimate requests and bookings for the CLIENT or in representation of other persons who have legally authorised the CLIENT to proceed with the booking; ii) that the CLIENT User is at least 18 years of age or has the legal capacity necessary to create a legal contract on behalf of the CLIENT; and iii) that any and all information supplied during the booking process is correct and true, for which the CLIENT accepts all financial responsibility resulting from any transaction carried out using the CLIENT’S access codes or on behalf of the CLIENT.<br/>
    
            <br/>6.2 Access codes<br/>
    
            <br/>The access codes for this program (user names and password) will be provided by GSTDM for each CLIENT, including any passwords that may be needed for each CLIENT user.<br/>
    
            Immediately after the initial access codes have been used for the first time to access the GSTDM booking service, each registered user assigned to the CLIENT must change their personal password (initially provided by GSTDM), to guarantee an absolute safeguard of the confidentiality, priority and independence when using the program.<br/>
    
            The access codes provided by GSTDM are for the sole use of each CLIENT and user, in such a way that no access code may be transferred or revealed to third parties, including their representatives or subsidiaries of the CLIENT.<br/>
    
            Each CLIENT and the personal user are directly responsible for the use of their own access codes, which must not be shared with other users nor disclosed by any means. In the event of improper use thereof, such access codes shall be withdrawn; sales will immediately be stopped and fraudulent bookings will be cancelled. In the event that GSTDM or the CLIENT  detect fraudulent or improper use of the access codes by the CLIENT, including its current and former employees, GSTDM reserves the right to take any legal action pursuant to the protection of its legitimate interest and claim the cancellation costs of the fraudulent bookings from CLIENT.<br/>
    
            For reasons of security, GSTDM reserves the right to change the access codes of the CLIENT so long as such changes shall not disrupt the use of the system by said CLIENT, and that sufficient notice of the planned change(s) is received by said CLIENT. In addition, the CLIENT should change the access codes from time to time for security reasons, especially every time a user is no longer employed by the CLIENT.<br/>
    
            <br/>6.3.- Contracting services<br/>
    
            <br/>The conclusion of the contracting process via the website is conditioned by this document and by the GSTDM Contract Terms and Conditions (hereinafter referred to as “Terms and Conditions”). The Terms and Conditions are an integral part of the website, and may not be separated from the Contract Terms and Conditions, the operational section or any bookings made. By accessing, viewing, using or contracting the website, the CLIENT consents to be governed by these Terms and Conditions. The CLIENT also agrees to abide by all laws and regulations that are applicable to this website and the bookings made through it.<br/>
    
            If the CLIENT does not wish to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, it must not proceed to book any tourist services on the website.<br/>

            May not use the website for any purpose other than for contracting the GSTDM product.<br/>
            May not send, transmit or issue on or via the website any information that may be damaging, obscene, defamatory or illegal in any other way for the rights of the GSTDM or any third parties.<br/>

            <br/><br/>6.4 Impossibility of handwritten signature
    
            <br/><br/>Due to the special nature of remote contracts, you hereby recognise the impossibility of signing the payment receipt, which is considered to acknowledge acceptance of the transaction.

            <br/>Notwithstanding any other of its rights, GSTDM reserves the right to deny access to this website and/or to cancel any bookings, should GSTDM deem (at its own discretion) that the CLIENT is failing to comply with any of the Terms and Conditions of this agreement.
